Tech Test Foothill Technology: F# Fundamentals

The first task was simple, but I think I overcomplicated it, edge cases like extra comma('2,3,'), 
generate a last empty string in the array when is converted from the input string. I choosed 
treat it like an invalid input, but i could've managed it deleting the last empty string from 
the array and just summing the previous numbers.

2nd task has better validation for extra comma and empty strings ('2,,5,2').
